# Trotter-and-Gleser-s-Formula-for-Stature-Estimation
This is a Forensic Anthropology project that includes a CLI calculator that works to estimate the height of an individual from the measure of a long bone. This project is for demonstration purposes only and is not a professional tool for forensic analysis.

The program prompts the measurements of long bones; humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia and fibula. The formula calculates the stature of the individual from each long bone. The equations are referenced from Trotter and Gleser's study in the year 1958 and as such it has the errors of being based on an old research and the study's innate disadvantage of a limited sample space. Adding to that this calculator also calculates the average stature from the estimated statures, this might further lead to the calculated value being further away from the actual value. The purpose of this project is as a demonstration of integrating Python with forensic anthropology. It is purely for an educational purpose and should not be considered a professional tool for forensic analysis.
